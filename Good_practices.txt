Our team is compossed by Aitor Quinza and Javier Hita.
Before starting the 3rd week's projects, we have agreed on some good practices, in order to work as smootly as possible. The agreed good practises are the following:
- All the libraries importations, will be imported at the top of the script.
- There repository will be compossed by 3 directories. The 1s with the scripts for data gathering, the 2nd with the csv's results from the data gathering scripts, and the 3rd with the data analysis scripts.
- Each file has to be in its corresponding directory, according to the previously defined structure.
- The functions with two words will be joined by an underscore.
- Each script will be compossed by two parts. Functions definition and workflow (calling the previously defined functions).
